<h1> MiV MCS file format converter </h1>

## Topic Description

Other than OpenEphys, the one we use for internal electrophysiology recording, many people use MCS (Multi-Channel Systems). They provide their native data format in HDF5 with python/matlab decoder.
We would like to provide either wrapper or guideline how to use MCS package to retrieve necessary data (raw signal or spikes), and convert to our signal/spiketrain format.
