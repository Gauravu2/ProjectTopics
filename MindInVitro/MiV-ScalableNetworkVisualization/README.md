## Topic Description

This project involves developing pipeline that visualizes large-scale [directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93R%C3%A9nyi_model) in a form that makes a neural-connectivity/activity easier to interpret, analyze, and debug. The graph is expected to be hierarchically structured and dynamically varying.
